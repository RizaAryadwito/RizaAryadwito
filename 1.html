                                    As a Computer Science student, I recognize both my strengths and areas for 
                                    improvement. I enjoy programming, mathematics, and logical problem-solving, 
                                    which help me sharpen my critical thinking skills. However, I also realize that 
                                    one of my personal challenges is sometimes feeling lazy or unmotivated to try 
                                    or learn new things. This can slow down my growth and prevent me from exploring 
                                    opportunities that might be valuable for my future.Through this reflection, 
                                    I understand the importance of building self-discipline and consistency in learning. 
                                    By actively pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone and explore new knowledge, 
                                    I believe I can overcome this weakness. My goal is to develop not only strong 
                                    technical skills but also the mindset and habits needed to become a reliable Full 
                                    Stack Developer or Software Engineer in the near future.
